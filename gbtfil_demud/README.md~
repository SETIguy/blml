Where to get the GBT Filterbank data
------------------------------------

See the event data set prepared by Isaac Shivvers:

https://gist.github.com/stevecroft/e297e9e7dc03ca2bab616ae1e712bedf

Download `Catalog2` (the event catalog with duplicates removed)
and `DataFiles`.  Unzip the data file:

   `$ tar -zxvf KeplerGBT1.4-1.5Ghz.tgz`

This creates one subdirectory per observing row (`Row_00` to `Row_89`).  
Inside each subdirectory are several .npy files, one per detected event.

How to run on GBT Filterbank data
---------------------------------

We added a new option to DEMUD to handle GBT filterbank data saved in .npy
files.  To use it:

1. If you haven't already, create an empty `demud.config` file by running

   `$ python demud.py --make-config`

2. Specify the pathname to the GBT data in `demud.config` (look for the
GBT filterbank data set section; specify `gbtdirname` and `catalogfile`). 

3. Run

   `$ python demud.py --gbtfil`

This version seeds DEMUD with the first item in the file.  It then
iteratively selects items that most differ from each one selected.  
By default, it runs with K=10 principal components.

Currently, the data reader only uses events with detection frequencies
within 5 MHz of 1420 MHz (see line 71 of `dataset_gbtfil.py` to modify).
This results in XXX observations and takes significant time to load them.

4. For more interesting results, try the following:

   `$ python demud.py --gbtfil --init-item=-1`: Seed DEMUD with the most
   unusual item in the entire data set (not the first item).

   `$ python demud.py --gbtfil --init-item=-1 --variance=0.8`: DEMUD 
   auto-selects the best K value needed to capture 80% of the variance 
   in the data set.
