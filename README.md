Breakthrough Listen Machine Learning code and documentation

Here you can find presentations, code, and documentation from the workshop at UC Berkeley on June 2 and 3 2016, in addition to further development of machine learning on Breakthrough Listen data.

# Experiments

* `apf_demud`: Ran DEMUD novelty detection on APF spectra
* `gbt_demud`: Ran DEMUD novelty detection on GBT filterbank data 
  that had been converted into spectra by averaging across a 5-minute window
* `gbtfil_demud`: Ran DEMUD novelty detection on GBT filterbank data (2D)
